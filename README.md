# DeckOfCards
Simple OO example of creating a deck of cards with shuffling and a couple other things.

Current implementation consists of creating a (standard)
deck of cards and shuffling.  Cards are generic enough
to support wildcards (e.g., Jokers in poker), but I haven't
gone too crazy implementing that.  Also support basic
card information (e.g., color) so they can be used for
Klondike or other games like that.

See JavaDoc for detailed information.
